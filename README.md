# React Profile Card Project

## Overview

The React Profile Card project enables users to create dynamic profile cards by providing information such as username, image address, online status, and skills. The project passes these values to the `UserCard.jsx` component, where the user card is rendered.

- **Dynamic Rendering**: Utilizes the `UserCard.jsx` component to dynamically render user profile cards with the provided information.

- **Online Status**: Displays the user's online status on the profile card, represented by different colors (green for online, yellow for offline).
